# PPMLib

**_Important_:** *Please check the notes below before using this software.*

(if you want a VB.NET version of the library, please go on the `VB-Latest` branch)

<pre>
This library can be used to read & write flipnotes, application such as players or exporters can be made with this library

We will not provide the private key required to sign flipnotes, you will have to find it online or get the key yourself.
</pre>

# Notes
- We remind Section 4.1.5 from Sudomemo Terms of Use: *``` The following activities are prohibited when using Sudomemo: [...] Exploits or content that wasnâ€™t created in the original Flipnote Studio software on a Nintendo DSi or Nintendo 3DS```*. We are not related to any modified versions of PPMLib which attempt to break Sudomemo's Terms Of Use, we will try our best to not have anything as such happen. (Flipnotes edited with the original PPMLib Library will have oddities to prevent uploads onto Sudomemo)
